# 📩 SMS Spam Detection App

A simple and efficient SMS spam detection web app built using Machine Learning and deployed on Streamlit.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Build a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as "spam" or "ham" (not spam).
- Preprocess and vectorize text data using CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer.
- Train and evaluate multiple ML models (Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression).
- Deploy the final model using Streamlit for user interaction.
- Provide a clean, interactive interface for SMS classification.
